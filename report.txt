In addition, SQLMAP comes with a detection engine that includes advanced features to support penetration testing


6.SQL NINJA 
	sqlininja exploits web applications that use Microsoft SQL Server as a database backend. Its focus is on getting a running shell on the remote host. sqlninja doesn't find an SQL injection in the first place, but automates the exploitation process once one has been discovered.


7.MSF VENOM 
	MSFvenom is a combination of Msfplayload and MSF encode putting both of these tools into a single framework instance

Advantage
	.one single tool

8.HYDRA TOOL
	Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add.

This tool makes it possible for researchers and security consultants to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access to a system remotely

9.NET CAT
	Netcat reads data from standard input (stdin) and writes it to a network connection (either TCP or UDP). Conversely, it can also read data from a network connection and write it to standard output (stdout). This bidirectional data flow makes it a powerful tool for various networking tasks. 

Key features 
	.TCP/UDP Connections
	.File Transfer
	.Remote Shell
	.Port Scanning


10.KALI LINUX

kali Linux are used by Penetration Testers ,Security Researchers,Digital Forensics Investigators,Cybersecurity Professionals.


11.OWASPzap
	It's used to find vulnerabilities in web applications by acting as a proxy, intercepting and analysing web traffic between a browser and a target application. ZAP can be used for both automated and manual testing, making it a versatile tool for security professionals and developers alike.

Functionality 
	.Dynamic Application Security Testing 
	.Extensible and Customizable
	.Active and Passive Scanning
	.Proxy Server 
	.Active and Passive Scanning
	.Vulnerability Detection
	

12.ETTER-CAP
	Ettercap is an open _source tool that can be used to support middle man attacks on networks.
Ettercap can capture packets and then write them back onto the, network . Ettercap enables the diversion and alteration of data virtually in real-time. Ettercap can also be used for the protocol analysis necessary to analyze network traffic. 
	While Ettercap can support network traffic analysis, the most frequent use of Ettercap is to set up man-in-the-middle attacks using ARP poisoning. Penetration testing you can emulate includes man-in-the-middle attacks, credentials capture, dns spoofing, and DoS attack.
	Ettercap also supports both active and passive deep analysis of many protocols and includes many features for network and host analysis. Many “sniffing” modes are available – this includes MAC based, IP based, ARP based (full duplex), and PublicARP based (half duplex). Ettercap can also detect a switched local area network (LAN) and use the OS fingerprints to determine the total geometry of the LAN. 

Ettercap is a necessary part of the tool inventory for any penetration tester or ethical hacker.
